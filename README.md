This presentaion was made for my Sport Analytics assignment. It is base on research work performed by Sricharan Shah n others in their research paper https://www.ijarcs.info/index.php/Ijarcs/article/viewFile/3072/3055.  

### Study on Performance of Cricket Players using Factor Analysis Approach:
PCA is unsupervised approach used to determine important components which explains the maximum variability.  
For the analysis, a dataset of 80 batsmen, 80 bowlers; & 90 batsmen, 90 bowlers have been considered from Indian Premier Leage (IPL) -9, 2016 (20 overs cricket) and International cricket Council (ICC) World Cup, 2015 (50 overs) respectively.  
The findings of this study reveals that batting capability dominates over bowling capability which is in conformity with an earlier study on same kind of game.
